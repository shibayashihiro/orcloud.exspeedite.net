<h1>Carrier&rsquo;s</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up Carriers begins with ensuring you have the carrier settings adjusted correctly, and this is easy to do. Go to the settings section, and you will see the list of carrier settings. The first thing is the financials, then terms and email notifications, making sure all parts are correct and up-to-date.</p>
<p>Once the settings are all correct, it is worth double checking all of them to be sure, you can then move on to the carrier profile screen.</p>
<p>Here you need to fill out all the information you have, and while you may not have enough to complete every part of the form, it is very important to ensure you have the email notification completed so the system can update things along the way.</p>
<p>Once all the available information is input there, especially the email notification, you then move on to creating a load. Once the load has been created, you can then assign a carrier in the text box. Typing in the first few letters of a carrier you have created in the system will allow you to select it, and then you can add on any dedicated trailers and so on the load requires if that is needed.</p>
<p>Once that is done, you can click on continue, which takes you to the trip/load screen. On the left you can click on the load itself, you can add the base, financials or fuel surcharge as applicable, it&rsquo;s very quick to do from that screen, just input the numbers.</p>
<p>Also on the left, you can click the dropdown, which allows you to change the state of the load or send a freight agreement. Choose this and a new popup screen appears, this allows you to input the Base Amount, and add a note to the carrier, and then save the agreement. Doing this removes the load from the trip/load screen, and to see the load again, simply pick Carrier Freight Agreement Sent from the dropdown menu at the top. Here you will see all loads that have had a freight agreement sent to the carrier. Switching to email, we can find agreement confirmations, once an agreement is confirmed by the carrier, a load can then be changed to dispatch status using the dropdown on the left, which then moves the load back to the main status screen.</p>
<p>If a load needs changing at any point, you can, at any point, edit the load from this screen, but any changes of course require sending a new agreement for approval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>City Dispatch</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Begin on the shipments screen, where we can sort or filter deliveries any way that suits the situation. You can search for specific recipients through the search box, or by clicking column headings, prioritize the list by that attribute.</p>
<p>Creating a load is straightforward, on the select shipment screen you will see a list of available shipments on the left, with the loads themselves on the right. You can create custom filters for shipment availability, for instance add a zip code, state or prefix and sort shipments by that. Simply go to the zone filter screen to set up appropriate filters.</p>
<p>You can simply drag and drop any shipment across to a load to add that shipment, and once you are happy, simply lick continue to get to the picks and drops page. You can change the way this is presented in settings, where it can be adjusted to show pick/drop/pick drop, or all picks together then all drops. The customizable interface is designed to work how you prefer, simply pick the one that suits. You can drag and drop each pick or drop until they are all in the right order.</p>
<p>Once everything is in order, simply click the green &lsquo;Resources&rsquo; button, and you arrive at the resources screen. Here you can assign a driver, tractor and trailer as needed. If you use mobile communications, times of picks and drops can be assigned through the drop downs for each entry.</p>
<p>You can assign drops to different doors or to a single place depending on your needs, again, a dropdown on the left provides the relevant options. Once docked, the shipments are ready to be assigned to delivery loads as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Client Rates</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add rates that can be assigned, go to the Client Rates List section, accessed through the Admin dropdown menu, it&rsquo;s near the bottom. Here you simply clock on the &lsquo;Add Rate&rsquo; green button, and here you can create any rate you wish, and name it for easy identification. The dropdown menu allows you to choose what category each rate is in, add the value and then add a description of each rate at the bottom.</p>
<p>To adjust client rates, you begin at the client screen. From here you can pick the client required, and simply select &lsquo;add client rate&rsquo; from the dropdown. This takes you to the client rate input screen, where you can adjust all rates.</p>
<p>Firstly, you can easily apply a fuel surcharge, scroll to the bottom of the screen, where the fuel surcharge interface is on the right. Simply choose the appropriate fuel surcharge you wish to use then click apply to client, and it will automatically be added to the rates at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Once you have input your rates, you can now apply any of these to your client in the client rates screen, simply add one or more rates in the client rates section at the bottom of the page, click apply and they will be added to the client rates for this client.</p>
<p>There are other options on the client rates screen, Pallet Rates allows you to set min and max charges pallets, and then apply that to a pallet number range through the &lsquo;Show Pallet Rates&rsquo; button. You can add different charges for various ranges, such as 1-5 and then 5-10 or more simply by adding more rates through the &lsquo;add pallet rate&rsquo; button.</p>
<p>Detention charges can be added in a similar way, with options for both Loaded and Unloaded detention rate as required.</p>
<p>Both Handling and Freight Charges operate on the same principal, adding charges and all required details places the charge on the client&rsquo;s rate automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Creating Shipments</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a shipment begins at the shipment page. The form itself is self-explanatory, simply requiring the relevant information to be added to each item.</p>
<p>For any shipment, clicking on the &lsquo;Add Detail&rsquo; button allows you to input all relevant information, where you can input the commodity type, number of pallets, number of items, weight and any other special requirements such as temperature, hazmat etc. as needed. Once all relevant information is correct, simply save changes and they are applied to the new shipment. They will then automatically populate the details page of the shipment. You can add more commodities to any shipment as needed by clicking &lsquo;add details&rsquo; again.</p>
<p>If you are using tracking software., you will see a tick next to each address associated with the shipment to confirm it is a validated address to aid efficiency. Once all details are correct, you can then simply click the green &lsquo;Ready to Dispatch&rsquo; button to save the shipment.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may need to ship through several locations for a single client. Creating different address profiles under a single client can be achieved through the use of individual labels for each setting. For instance, setting a shipper with a different address to a recipient can accommodate different plants in the same organization, naming them appropriately makes it easy to track. This is useful for multiple drops to different branches of a single client, retaining all billing information in a single place while allowing you to treat each location separately for transport purposes.</p>
<p>Once shipments are delivered, you may still need to review them, shipment history is accessed through the shipment edit button of delivered shipments, and will allow you to see who picked and delivered the shipment, as well as full details of the load itself.</p>
<h1>Driver Pay Setup</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing to note when looking to change driver pay settings is that it requires admin level users. Edit user through the admin menu takes you to the relevant screen, and under groups, Admin needs to be checked on to be able to make driver Pay changes.</p>
<p>Assuming that you have Admin access, then Driver Rates are accessed through the admin menu, and you begin by simply clicking the &lsquo;Add Rates&rsquo; Button. The first item is a drop down that allows you to choose the category for the rate, then a zone the rate applies to, and then add a value for the rate itself. Click the green save button, and the rate is created and saved into the system.</p>
<p>The next step is to access the &lsquo;Manage Rate Profile&rsquo; section, again, this is reached through the Admin menu. This applies to the different contracts you have, and here you can add rates, holiday pay, manual pay, range rates and so on as needed. Driver rates can be added to these contracts very simply by choosing the appropriate one from the list at the bottom and clicking &lsquo;Apply Rate&rsquo;. You can add more rates as required, and delete rates applying to the contract by clicking the delete symbol next to the rate at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Adding a contract to a drive is done through the Drivers Screen, again, accessed through the Admin menu. Select a driver and click &lsquo;Add Rate&rsquo;, and then simply choose the right contract from the dropdown menu.</p>

<p>This will take you to the drivers own page, where you will be able to see all payments made to the driver previously.

This takes you to a new screen that includes all loads associated with the driver for that week, with a total of miles and so on all displayed.</p>
<p>You can review each load from here with all information provided, including pay. At this point you can add any Stop Off as required, and then save each load as you are happy with the information. Saved loads will now appear under the Settlement History for the driver, although note that the load is not finalized yet and can still be adjusted or even deleted from the driver&rsquo;s history if needed. By clicking on the Dollar sign, you can go back and add new loads to the payment as required.</p>

Once satisfied, you can then click the green &lsquo;Finalize statement&rsquo; button at the bottom of the page. This will take you can to the driver&rsquo;s settlement history page, but the entry will now show as &lsquo;Finalized&rsquo; and you will be unable to edit or add to the week&rsquo;s pay any further.</p>
<p>Once completed, you can then run a report and send out the settlement statement for each driver.</p>
